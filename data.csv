Compass Nutrition,Active Life,"Are you looking for a fresh approach to eating? Compass Nutrition creates a trusting and supportive environment to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle. We do not believe in judgment, deprivation, punishment, guilt, and all-or-nothing rules. 

We focus on creating enjoyable habits that lead to healthy behaviors. Our approach is simple: eat what you like, learn to moderate certain foods and make informed food decisions. 

We teach our patients new skills or reinforce current skills, so that they can get to know and trust their own body cues, move away from diet rules (and rule breaking), learn better and more insight-oriented coping strategies. Our goal is to move towards a more natural, balanced, self-led style of eating and relationship with food.

During your appointment, you will find that our treatments go beyond issuing short-term meal plans. We help our patients figure out what got their eating off-track and what perceptions, attitudes, and life-style habits are contributing factors.

For some, finding that balance is merely a matter of awareness - of how to bring a fresh approach of good eating and physical activity to each day.

For others, coordinating medical nutrition therapy and daily physical activity with other health care professionals and support groups may be what is needed.

Whatever your needs are we can individually assess and design a plan that is right for you and your goals.

Rolfing Structural Integration is a highly effective way of working with the body-mind to resolve conflicts, which prevent easier, more efficient ways of moving and being. A Rolfer® is highly trained to see, and address the complex ways in which the body-mind is relating to itself and its environment. The more balanced these relationships are, the more choice we will have in our experience. Through hands-on manipulation, and movement (perceptual) education, Rolfing is a very precise and effective way to change deep-set habits of posture, movement, and orientation. Rolfing is an effective approach to addressing the after-effects of accidents, injuries, and for many cases of acute and chronic pain. How we are in our bodies contextualizes perception, and the activity of the mind in general. For these reasons, Rolfing can be useful in affecting positive change in emotional, and behavioral issues.

Our practice is not just for back pain, but also sport-related injuries and chronic movement dysfunction. All of these problems can wreak havoc on our overall health and well being.

Norman Marcus Pain Institute,Active Life,"Whether your pain is recent or long-standing, it should not be ignored. Ongoing pain can interfere with every aspect of life, ranging from the ability to sleep to the capacity to enjoy daily activities. The Norman Marcus Pain Institute provides consultation, state-of-the-art protocols to diagnose the cause of pain, and treatments that help patients eliminate (or manage) the source of their discomfort.

NMPI successfully eliminates pain in patients who were previously diagnosed with sciatica, radiculopathy, failed back surgery syndrome, degenerative disc disease, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS, previously called reflex sympathy dystrophy, or RSD), plantar fasciitis, or Fibromyalgia Syndrome. NMPI improves the quality of patient's lives.
Evaluation
A visit begins with an evaluation to determine the source of pain. Determining why you have pain is both simple and complicated. Pain that began in the past 2 months is generally easier to understand than pain that has troubled you for years.

In addition to identifying pain that may come from a herniated disc or a squeezed nerve, Dr. Marcus evaluates muscles, the most common cause of back and neck pain, as possible sources of pain.

Just Feel Good,Active Life,"Hi there, my name is Coleen and I'm a nutrition consultant and wellness entrepreneur running a successful private practice in NYC with an office in Manhattan (Flatiron) and Brooklyn (Prospect Heights). People see me to reach their goal weight, gain energy, eliminate cramps &amp; PMS, mangage PCOS, sleep better, clear up digestive issues, stop sugar addiction, manage depression, clear up skin conditions, speed their metabolism and learn how to eat healthfully in an increasingly unhealthy world. My program is not a quick fix but rather a long term solution to many chronic issues (and yes, dieting is a chronic issue!). Submit a health history form via my website (click ""Get Started"" on the home page) to reserve your free consultation.

Acupuncture works.  

Acupuncture improves flow of oxygen (Qi), blood (Xue) and nutrients (Ying) to nourish every cell, organ and physiological system of the body.  Impaired flow of blood and oxygen causes Blood Stagnation, which prevents the body from functioning properly, resulting in disease, pain, inability to heal, and emotional disturbances. Acupuncture dilates blood vessels to improve blood flow, which improves organ function, relieves pain, and minimizes aging.

Acupuncture stimulates the nervous system by activating sensory nerves that travel through the skin, along the spine and into the brain, stimulating the release of opioids to shut off pain signals and eliminate pain.

A multitude of scientific studies using modern techniques such as MRI, show that Acupuncture modulates areas of the brain which initiate changes in bodily functions. Specific Acupuncture points are seen to stimulate/moderate specific areas of the brain. These effects continue to work over hours and days, and the effects are cumulative.",sophieyoungacupuncture.com,(917) 446-5275,"Diamond St Brooklyn, NY 11222 ","https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oNbWNuAM0dtsFAb_p19Bpg/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q8fdFw4nnVjW6eIn5wnUiA/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RgC0RJFg9G0z5bTsIUQlUQ/o.jpg,","Acupuncture,Traditional Chinese Medicine,",Brooklyn,11222

The preschool years are a crucial window in a child's academic, social and cultural development. In the few years spent at The International Preschools, a child will develop not only academic skills but also social skills and cultural attitudes. At The International Preschools, where English language learners are welcomed and supported, children and families from New York City and all over the world share their cultures and gain a sense of international awareness through mutual understanding and respect. Through play, we promote the cognitive, emotional, social and physical growth of each child in a nurturing atmosphere.

"Nick Helbich, PhD, LCSW",Active Life,"Life today is more complicated than ever. I can provide the help you need to meet life's challenges. Let's begin this journey to the life you want to live.

My clients and I meet usually on a weekly basis. For people who travel a lot I offer Skype and phone sessions.

My fee is $ 250.00 to 300.00 per session which is reimbursed if you have out of network benefits.

Although we tend to categorize therapies, we can't do the same with people, as everyone has a completely different set of experiences and problems. And so I draw from a wide variety of treatment methods. My clinical orientation and training is integrative, as it combines Psychodynamic, Interpersonal and Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) perspectives. I am well schooled in Modern Psychoanalysis, Self Psychology, Focusing and Client Centered Therapy and have received extensive training in individual, couples and group psychotherapy. One of the approaches I often use is mindfulness meditation, as the body holds onto past traumas that our minds may not always remember. I will discuss all the treatment options with you and find the one that will work best for you.

I provide treatment options that can also help with difficult relationships involving family, friends, even co-workers.",dr-nick-helbich.com,(646) 270-7255,"205 West 15th St Ste 6-T The Chelsmore New York, NY 10011 ","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hlHIA1UVUNG3iy7FUBmZOw/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XD17Q24WO8KFP3TvXOV6xA/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7sETlchTuPULrT28jVhsYA/o.jpg,","Psychologists,",New York,10011

Rather than offering patients a single option for care we have combined the best of several independent practices and specialties to create a more effective way at treating pain. The office has assembled specialists in orthopedics, physical therapy, internal medicine, pain management, physical medicine, chiropractic and acupuncture. By bringing together several independent practices a patient can get get the best of what each specialist has to offer at one location.
The result is patients have a greater chance of getting out of pain and just as importantly, staying out of pain.
The response from patients and professional peers has been tremendous. The office continues to gain recognition as one of the premier musculoskeletal facilities in New York. The ultimate validation of the approach has been the fact almost all of the facilities patients have been referred from other patients and physicians.

"Kim Borselli, DC",active,"Adjustments &amp; Manipulation

Dr. Borselli uses and is expertly trained in the most recognized and researched spinal care program in the United States: Activator Methods. This system of care uses non force, gentle, instrument adjusting. In addition she adds postural traction and specific exercises to correct spinal and posture deviations and help move you back towards alignment. Several recent clinical trials and case studies have documented the dramatic improvement in patients with a variety of diseases and conditions back towards health and wellness.

Electrical Muscle Manipulation

Electrical Muscle Stimulation is an exceptionall way to help the body in the healing process. This is accomplished by sending a very small electrical current into the affected soft tissue injury or muscle spasm. The therapy utilizies this current in an effort to help reduce swelling and release trigger points that may have the muscle locked up. It does this by helping the body to release natural relievers of pain often referred to as endorphins. This is an excellent adjunctive therapy used with Chiropractic specific spinal adjustments. If there is a spasm in a neck, or back muscle, it works well in relaxing the muscle and allowing it to return to its normal state rather quickly.  Short therapy sessions are excellent at facilitating healing from acute and chronic pain.

Moxie Yoga & Fitness,yoga,"Moxie is a collaboration of Mark Rausa and David Steele's effort to provide a space and community where practitioners can reap the benefits of yoga with efficient classes that focus specifically on postures and breathing exercises, the third and forth limbs of yoga.   Although yoga does have roots in philosophy, we have honed our efforts into developing the most balanced and effective yoga practice instead of focusing on the emotional or what one may interpret as spiritual instruction that is common in the yoga practice today.

Our excellent team of instructors represent our approach and methodology through thoughtfully designed sequencing.  In addition to providing athleticism in a balanced body practice, we focus on learning and progression in the yoga practice.  This is accomplished by providing individual attention and assistance which we are able to offer because of our smaller studio sizes.

The Moxie Method is our signature approach to yoga inspired fitness. It is a form of power yoga that is physically inspired and based on modifications of the traditional Ashtanga Vinyasa system.  What sets the Moxie Method apart is the framework of fundamental postures that provides for a vigorous yet balanced practice that is scalable and constantly evolving.",moxie.yoga,(415) 529-1546,"3315 20th St San Francisco, CA 94110 ","https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h3uFCErBI6BPGW4bafawJQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pRjJE_mqH-KLk4xxL7ieFw/o.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RIh9SqlCMhoMQ3pkbmTXlA/o.jpg,","Yoga,",San Francisco,94110

Devi Rebel Yoga,yoga,"Yoga •  Fitness •  Wellness • Community
Special Promotion - Two First Classes Free Or Two Weeks Unlimited for $45
Strengthen the body. Quiet the mind. Lift the Spirit.
Devi Yoga is a story of slow, constant growth: planting a seed and patiently watching it grow over time. The Devi's intention was to create a space that would embody nurturing, dynamic, powerful and gentle qualities that honor the harmony of nature in one's yoga practice. Devi yoga is our home base, the calm, the rock that gives us the inner strength to do so much more in life.

Our inner Rebel likes to kick it up and work to transform our bodies. As passionate about our yoga as we are, we are equally passionate about keeping our bodies fit. Strong muscles support joints and prevent injuries in the yoga room and in life. This overall fitness gives us the physical strength to tackle everything else in life.

Health is multi-dimensional. We are spiritual beings in a material world working daily to become more in touch with our inner selves. Through holistic wellness, coming to our mat with other like minded yogis to let go of that which does not serve us and keeping our bodies strong and vibrant we achieve the mindset and the healthset to uplift our mind, body &amp; spirit.

Corporate wellness: I believe that corporations have the potential to create tremendous sustainable growth in technology, healthcare, and business... but in order for these profound changes to happen, front-line employees must have the mental and physical capacity for creativity. Through my coordination with company wellness programs, I created a program to support employees' physical and mental health through yoga, meditation, personal development and nutrition. 

On an individual level, I use yoga and health coaching to support women in improving their health. Through coaching and/or yoga, I support women in making lifestyle shifts to prepare for a healthy pregnancy, improve thyroid condition and/or adrenal fatigue, or have better quality periods.

Asana choices are deliberate with options offered to keep everyone in the room working intelligently within his or her body structure and connected to his or her breath. I have a passion for unusual transitions that educate body mechanics and efficient movement. The ""hatha flow"" style I guide shares influences from many schools of yoga such as Ashtanga, Kundalini, Smart Flow, Yoga Tune Up ®, and Yin. Yoga has been my passion since 1998. I love exploring many approaches to the practice. Light chanting, philosophy, the occasional ""aha"" moment, as well as a palpable love of inversions and arm balances make into the room. ""Yoga to You"" is my motto.

You deserve more than that.

Do you feel you are destined to a life of struggle and disappointment, no matter what you do? Are you feeling stuck (when it comes to your work, relationships, finances, or health) ~ and want to break free from the stagnation?

I created Essential Transformation to help high achievers maximize their potential and optimize their lives!

Only YOU can transform your life. Your version of success starts with an intention, grows with a vision, and manifests with consistent effort. I will provide you with the tools you need to ignite your intention, clarify your vision, and propel the manifestation of your abundant success. If you’re ready to take your life to the next level, I’d love to help you make the transformation!

Private Sessions
The fastest path to meeting your personal goals, whether you are a new to Pilates or are already a regular practitioner is with private sessions. We highly recommend that all participants start with private sessions before taking any group classes.

We are a chiropractic office in Tustin conveniently located off the 5 freeway serving Tustin, Irvine, Orange, Costa Costa and the rest of Orange County.

Call 714-535-6535 

Dr. Shouka is a chiropractor in Tustin that uses a hands-on treatment approach that realigns the whole body through gentle pressure and stretching. Spine, pelvis and ribcage deformations are corrected with a slow and constant pressure that carefully guides the body into correct posture. Tight muscles are released to allow the opposite muscles to reset and get stronger. This method goes beyond standard chiropractic and produces more lasting results.

We combine the best of the manual therapies, chiropractic, and holistic care with the best active therapies, Pilates, Yoga and exercises to provide comprehensive treatments. We have consistent results with patients suffering from various spine and sport injuries.

Our spinal therapy allows the patients' discs to rebuild naturally.  As the spinal discs rebuild and the ligaments get stronger the nerve irritation dissipates and the muscles can relax.  The patients feel less pain and more strength,  balance, flexibility, and coordination.

We have over 29 years of experience in the chiropractic profession helping people in Tustin, Irvine, Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and throughout Orange County.

At CKO Kickboxing, you will be burning fat and toning up by punching and kicking a real, hanging heavy bag. The resistance from hitting a hanging heavy bag burns more calories and tones your muscles up faster than if you were just punching and kicking the air. We keep the punches and kicks basic to focus on the fitness aspect of the workout rather than the martial art itself. Since the class is for both beginners and advanced members, it is geared for each member to go at your own pace and build up your pace each class.

New Wave Fitness,yoga,"The New Wave Fitness method of strength training is unlike any you have tried previously. Although you will be able to complete a total body strength session in less than 30 minutes, this technique will take each worked muscle to a state of complete fatigue.  In traditional-style weight training, lifters use momentum, and gravity to help them lift heavier weights and lift them faster, to snap the weights back and forth performing a few sets of eight to twelve repetitions. They risk repetitive trauma to the joints, ligaments, and tendons. The slow-motion strength training builds muscle better than any other form of training (about twice as fast as traditional weight training). It turns your body into a fat –burning machine not because of the extra calories you expend in the workout but because of the metabolic and hormonal changes it brings.",newwavefitnesscenters.com,(949) 533-3662,"22762 Aspan St Suite 212 Lake Forest, CA 92630 ","https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CtkfY2Gtj0MjND65lkeuAA/o.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/19A4t8jBF96Kw-caa3FGow/o.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lDWeAOox8wsXyrg6hHifpw/o.jpg,","Trainers,Gyms,",Lake Forest,92630

Hypnobirthing is a simple, straightforward program, thoughtfully developed over the years to remind mothers of the simplicity of birth itself. Just as the majority of birthing women do not need interventions and procedures for safe and healthy birth, they do not need a complex set of exercises and scripts to prepare themselves for peaceful, calm and comfortable birthing. The birthing body and the baby know just what to do. 

Hypnobirthing is designed to teach women (and their birth companions) to trust in nature's way of birth and to relax and let their bodies do what is needed. By practicing a few key techniques, mothers program their minds and condition their bodies to birth easily. When it comes to programming and conditioning, variety is not necessarily a good thing.

Sidney Wilson Personal Training,fitness,"I have had a passion for fitness and helping others since I was a little boy growing up in Auburndale, FL. Ever since I can remember I was doing pushups, playing sports and was always active with something fitness related.

 I was motivated to start working out more seriously at the age of 16 after my grandparents had passed away. I have had 6 members of my family pass away from heart disease, stokes, diabetes and other medical conditions relating to poor health, eating habits and lack of a fitness lifestyle. Not only did that motivate me to start working our more seriously, it also 
made me want to help others achieve their fitness goals because the impact my family's death had on me.

 I started personal training over 10 years ago and have worked with some of the biggest names in the industry. Shortly after I began personal training I took up male physique competitions and physique modeling. I have been blessed to have been featured in such international magazines such as Men's Health, Muscle and Fitness, Men's Fitness, Sports Illustrated and several others. I have also been featured as a fitness expert on several TV shows, news stations and reality shows.

 Fitness has opened up so many doors in my life and I want to give back to others who would like to have a more fit lifestyle, a leaner more sculpted physique and improve their muscle quality...",sidneywilson.com,(646) 226-6359,"5693 S Jones Blvd Ste 103 Las Vegas, NV 89118 ","https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ANsFW05BGxKKS4MEPfPqZw/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/u7nSXMk5OEMPZCxLVt2nGQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8x_yvVhFqWIAUBjraMfvWw/o.jpg,","Trainers,",Las Vegas,89118

SuperHuman Transformation,fitness,"My name is Paul Tijerina. My friends and clients call me ""Terina"" or ""T."" My vision is to awaken as many people as possible to the truth about real food, functional fitness, and lifestyle factors that are crucial for developing optimal, vibrant health.

I work with individuals looking to feel better, have better energy levels, improve digestion and lose body fat. I also work with workplace groups, CrossFit gyms and other fitness facilities looking to improve the health and performance of their members.

My methodology, Powered by Real Food, is based on several real food and therapeutic methodologies such as Paleo, Primal, West A Price, and Gut And Psychology Syndrome. Through this program we sift through the truths and myths of ""conventional wisdom"" and go into detail about how to assess, and how to implement real food.

SuperHuman Transformation is my 8-week food, fitness, and lifestyle challenge. My goal is to get you on the path toward optimal health for life, empowering you with the knowledge and tools to feel better than ever. This program is available for workplace groups, gyms, and even neighborhood groups who can gather 10 or more participants.

Whether you hope to improve your health, improve your performance, or address a specific dysfunction, everyone will benefit from this Real Food approach.

Capoeira Brazilian Pelourinho da Topázio,fitness,"Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art form that combines elements of fighting, music, culture, dance, and acrobatics. It is characterized by agility and disguised movements. It requires precise techniques either made close to the ground or upside down. One can also say that Capoeira is an art of fight dialogue between players - a conversation through movement, which can take on many shades of meaning. A feature that distinguishes Capoeira from other martial arts is the fact that it is accompanied by music and an art of somewhat ""playful fighting.""
Often people underestimate Capoeira because they don't see the combat. The reality is that if some is not able to defend themselves in slow motion then there is no reason to attack them fast.

Today many children have become so accustomed to receiving instant gratification that lessons in self-control and discipline aren't always easy to come by. Children who practice martial arts, however, are continually engaged in learning how essential self-discipline is and how imperative it is to respect yourself and others.

DeNovo Clinic,fitness,"DeNovo Clinic is an all-natural nutrition and weight-loss clinic that offers a variety of programs created to fit each individual's needs.  

We offer 2 weight-loss protocols of HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin), which is a hormone produced during pregnancy and when it is taken in small doses on a daily basis and absorbed into a person's blood stream will take away one's appetite. HCG is known as a ""super hormone"" which means that it aides the body in creating more hormones from the pituitary, hypothalamus, adrenal, and thyroid glands, when there is an imbalance in these hormones, it will generally cause weight gain.
-Injections (Rx): HCG peptide will be self-injected once a day along with another injection of B-12/fat burner. It requires a doctor visit, which we will set up.  
-Advantage Spray (Hx): Homeopathic form of HCG that mimics what HCG does for the body. With this protocol, patients also receive 1 bottle of Edge, energy and appetite support and 1 bottle of Super-B12, which helps with boosting mood, energy, concentration, and immune system.

School Selection
We help families new to America with early education and elementary educational planning.

Parent Coaching
Helping parents reduce stress and anxiety is one of our main missions. Parent coaching is a supportive relationship that helps you become the parent you want to be by identifying your parenting strengths and adding on to those with news skills, tools, and ideas. 

Custom Group Programs
Our custom group programs create a unique learning opportunity for your parent's or children's group large or small.

Tutoring

Bebe Landers Art Studio,education,"My name is Bebe Landers of Bebe Landers Art Studio and I am a professional artist residing in Laguna Beach, CA. I specialize in oil paintings seeking to inspire aspiring new artists with fun, educational painting classes. Through ten comprehensive, step by step art lessons, I can teach you the fundamentals and the techniques you'll need to create expressive paintings that you'll be proud of. Whether you're simply seeking a new creative hobby or if you want to take your first steps towards becoming a professional artist, it's my goal to foster and nurture your skills and increase your appreciation for fine art in a fun and relaxing way.

I love telling visual stories about a wide variety of subjects. People, places and things always appear in my work.  From real to dream imagery, my paintings are infused with a recognizable world.

The paintings take many sessions, and each painting session adds a new layer of mystery and magic to the image.

I feel an image is successful when the collector of the painting tells me they love to look and look and look.

My collectors enjoy sharing with me the memory or meaning invoked by the painting as they contemplate it in their homes.

Sharing universal human memories filled with love, light and hope crafted as a single pictorial moment, is the beauty in art that I strive for.""",bebelanders.com,(310) 210-8398,"Laguna Beach, CA 92651 ","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DrxKoav_kIKgrzRiegslOA/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7_cIB7JEwEqHplYJaSP3zg/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_lMpOulbwkzCCf8XmgJJGA/o.jpg,","Commissioned Artists,Paint & Sip,Art Classes,",Laguna Beach,92651

Hypnobirthing is designed to teach women (and their birth companions) to trust in nature's way of birth and to relax and let their bodies do what is needed. By practicing a few key techniques, mothers program their minds and condition their bodies to birth easily. When it comes to programming and conditioning, variety is not necessarily a good thing.

Hypnobabies is famous for much shorter, easier and more comfortable labors, making childbirth the joyful experience it was meant to be.
You'll use your Hypnobabies Workbook, CDs and hypnosis scripts to train your inner mind that contractions in labour will be felt only as pressure, tightening, pushing, pulling and normal baby movement sensations. You'll be fully in tune with your baby during the birthing process, and as aware as you'd like to be, easily able to communicate and be in charge of your own birth experience.
Hypnobabies uses the same kind of hypnosis techniques that people employ when preparing for surgery without any medication, which is called hypno-anesthesia. Our classes also teach our Hypnobabies Birth Partners how to fully support our Hypno-Moms, although Hypnobabies can also be used very successfully by single mothers.

Our students work as apprentices in one of our partner restaurants, gaining hours of practice and real world experience that is normally reserved for those who have already graduated culinary school. By reinforcing what they're learning while working in a real professional kitchen, our students are faster, more skilled, and better prepared to enter the foodservice industry full time after they complete our programs.

Instead of spending countless hours reading culinary textbooks as homework or sitting through uninspired lectures, our students watch comprehensive video demonstrations and navigate online curriculum. We've partnered with Rouxbe to provide an engaging video-driven learning experience

We put a strong emphasis on finding the best music teachers who not only play well but also teach well so your children can nurture their interest in music without needing a fresh start down the line. 

We offer toddler music classes for 2-3-year-olds, group piano classes for 4-5-year-old beginners and private piano lessons for older students. 

In addition to piano lessons, we also offer guitar lessons, violin lessons, voice lessons, and small voice ensemble classes.",irvinepianostudio.com,(949) 407-9833,"5510 Trabuco Rd Ste 200 Irvine, CA 92620 ","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OAGX4Zs0gnj-8XUm0yrIRg/o.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7v9f5ye3dNQ4a0eysM1uow/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B5MPR8qxBGRse9bx1Lp0jw/o.jpg,","Musical Instruments & Teachers,",Irvine,92620

Through open-ended and child-oriented activities, a child can be exposed to basic skills (for example, learning numbers, letters, shapes, etc.) that will allow them to have a positive attitude towards future educational experiences. In this manner, we can structure a child's learning day while also giving each child the cushion of creativity that is imperative to learning.

Hollywood Improv,lifecoach,"Since 1963, the Improvisation Comedy Clubs have remained the premier stages for live comedy in the United States. Over the decades, the talent who have graced Improv stages represent the Who's Who in American comedy.

Located at the epicenter of the entertainment world, the legendary Hollywood Improv opened decades ago and continues to deliver a combination of A-list comedy, great food and strong cocktails. In the days leading up to its 1975 opening, a young Jay Leno could be found helping paint the ceilings. The club's iconic brick wall and trademark piano have become symbols of   stand-up comedy around the globe. Hollywood Improv is recognized for developing the careers of countless comedy superstars and providing the setting for the popular television show, ""An Evening at the Improv.""

As in New York, the next generation of artists and entertainment executives worked the Improv--on stage, in the house, and behind the bar. Actor/comedian Adam Devine (""Workaholics,"" ""Pitch Perfect""), comedy manager Jimmy Miller (Jim Carrey), and writer/producer/director Judd Apatow (""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"") were part of the fraternity of door managers. Actress Debra Winger (""Urban Cowboy,"" ""Terms of Endearment"") and writer Callie Khouri (""Thelma &amp; Louise"") were waitresses. And the very first bartender was actor/comedian Kevin Nealon (""SNL,"" ""Weeds"").",hollywood.improv.com,(323) 677-0798,"8162 Melrose Ave Hollywood, CA 90046 ","https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CpW8Cc7ELY9V_25kOqybfA/o.jpg,","Comedy Clubs,Venues & Event Spaces,",Hollywood,90046

Studio Ruby Resonance Repatterning Healing Arts,lifecoach,"What is Repatterning?  

Is a powerful remedy to deal with trauma, anxiety, feeling stuck in life, self confidence, relationships and self sabotaging behaviors. 

If you have a recurring problem, that’s typically an unconscious pattern.  You may find yourself saying, “I keep doing this same thing or having the same relationships over &amp; over again.”   

Well, that’s a pattern you cannot do anything about at the conscious level.  We can go in and address the root cause, which disrupts the pattern instantly in most cases, helping your problem to heal.

This inclusive model benefits both types of students tremendously as curriculum goals focus on language development, which is fundamental for early learning, and are tailored to each child's individual needs. 

The pre-school programs focus on oral language. Within a traditional curriculum, speech-language pathologists provide intensive language therapy in a small group setting targeting the unique needs of each child. 

The school-aged program's small group setting and the low student/teacher ratio make it possible to provide personal attention and tailored instruction for children with language-based learning differences or children who struggle to be heard in a large public school setting.

Agni The Dance Company,dance_schools,"Agni - Pioneers of Bollywood in Austin

Bollywood dance may seem like the latest craze, appearing to mainstream audiences after the release of Slumdog Millionaire in 2008. But this dance form has been evolving over the last century in the Hindi film industry based in Mumbai. Innovative choreographers have been combining classical and folk Indian styles with disco, jazz, and jive. At cultural events across North America, South Asians have borrowed the movement from the screen and combined them with styles they have learned in the diaspora: hip hop, salsa, and modern. Bollywood is an eclectic style with a distinctly global flair--Bollywood dance is for everyone!

Agni is actively committed to building community in the greater Austin area.  The company not only performs at city-sponsored events such as Diwali celebrations at Zilker Park, but also annually organizes Bollywood Day in central Austin.  The company has also collaborated with other local artists and dance companies to produce full length shows such including Om Shanti (a Bollywood style musical) and Strings of Time (a musical interpretation of scientific theories).  
Most recently, Agni has introduced Agni Fit, an opportunity for people of all ages and body types to get healthy while rocking out to Bollywood songs with trained and competent instructors.  We continue to extend our reach into the community by offering performances, choreography, and workshops at schools, companies, and private events.",agnidance.com,(512) 761-8759,"Austin, TX 78750 ","https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eHZaF0Birct-WmsfnQvY8g/o.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xDeOV34Snsz66He2w6e5Uw/o.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eLHPMGXqlfM2jP8hWvwTVQ/o.jpg,","Dance Schools,",Austin,78750
