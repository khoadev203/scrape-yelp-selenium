Compass Nutrition,nutritionists,"Are you looking for a fresh approach to eating? Compass Nutrition creates a trusting and supportive environment to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle. We do not believe in judgment, deprivation, punishment, guilt, and all-or-nothing rules. 

We focus on creating enjoyable habits that lead to healthy behaviors. Our approach is simple: eat what you like, learn to moderate certain foods and make informed food decisions. 

We teach our patients new skills or reinforce current skills, so that they can get to know and trust their own body cues, move away from diet rules (and rule breaking), learn better and more insight-oriented coping strategies. Our goal is to move towards a more natural, balanced, self-led style of eating and relationship with food.

During your appointment, you will find that our treatments go beyond issuing short-term meal plans. We help our patients figure out what got their eating off-track and what perceptions, attitudes, and life-style habits are contributing factors.

For some, finding that balance is merely a matter of awareness - of how to bring a fresh approach of good eating and physical activity to each day.

For others, coordinating medical nutrition therapy and daily physical activity with other health care professionals and support groups may be what is needed.

Whatever your needs are we can individually assess and design a plan that is right for you and your goals.

My specialities include prenatal, postnatal, pediatrics, and plant-based diets. I make it easier for moms-to-be, mothers, and their families to choose the foods that they love while also nourishing and fueling themselves. Incorporating a positive relationship with foods and your eating habits can make such a huge difference in your health (and life) and you can take control over this with the right guidance. As an RD, I only provide scientifically backed, evidence-based nutrition advice. I also rely heavily on my plant-based approach. I focus so much on plant-based foods because the research consistently indicates how beneficial having a diet full of these types of foods is. I encourage my clients to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains while still enjoying things like pizza, chips, chocolate, and cake. I truly believe that health and happiness comes from a well-balanced diet that emphasizes plants but also leaves room for the other stuff.

Whole Body Cryotherapy (WBC) exposes the body to sub-zero temperatures -- as low as -240 degrees -- for short periods of time (2-3 minutes), initiating various therapeutic responses within the biochemistry. As the skin responds to the rapidly cooling temperatures, it signals a chain of physiological reactions that stimulate circulation, healing and detoxification.

Gravity Colon Hydrotherapy
Gravity Colon Hydrotherapy uses the natural flow of gravity to introduce water into the body. Using the latest in water filtration technology, our custom-made treatment rooms use ultra-purified water to dissolve and carry wastes away. Our team is certified in the Woods Method of Gravity Colonics and is additionally trained in-house before joining our team.

Our guiding principals on assessing and treating chronic illness:

The body, if given the ideal internal/cellular/energetic environment conducive to healing, can heal any disease that is created within the body.

All true healing is ultimately self-healing.

At NNM we do not focus on treating the disease, but on doing whatever is needed to awaken the natural self-healing mechanism inside the patient.

When this self-healing/self-repair mechanism is awakened, even after decades of being severely ill, we have seen patients make miraculous recoveries. 

If given the appropriate stimulation and kept free from disease causing factors, the body is designed to always move towards health.

With extremely rare exceptions, this self-healing response can be achieved using strictly natural, drug-free methods available at NNM.

7. There are an infinite number of health complaints/symptoms that
exist, but there are only 6-7 causes of disease.

I treat all kinds of musculoskeletal conditions including but not limited to neck, headaches, shoulder, hip, back, knee, sciatica, feet and arthritis. The chiropractic adjustment varies from gentle manipulation to manual manipulation. Adjunctive therapy available at the office includes ultrasound, electric muscle stimulation, cervical/lumbar traction and hot/cold packs. The adjustment and therapy is tailored to the individual patient.

I have been a chiropractor and nutritionist for 25 years. On the initial chiropractic visit, the patient has a thorough exam and leaves understanding what is wrong and how long it will take to correct their condition. Nutrition patients leave knowing what supplements they need to take and a diet tailored to them.

What also makes us unique is the DRX 9000, a non-surgical Lumbar disc decompression machine for herniated and bulging discs and sciatica.

Toni Gerbino,nutritionists,"Is extra weight hampering your health and life? Is the scale stuck, despite your best dieting efforts? Worse yet, does the weight you lost come creeping back? You need a CORE PLAN.
The goal of the Diet Alternatives Plan is to find your individual CORE PLAN: the right combination of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to speed your metabolism, the essential first step to ensure weight-loss success. The next step is to determine if there are existing food sensitivities that will inhibit your weight loss. Few people realize food sensitivities are a leading factor in slow weight loss, and why the weight you lose keeps returning. The Diet Alternatives Plan is completely unique. No other system is similar. The diet method  cannot be found in a bookstore or your doctor's office. Invented, developed and tested by certified nutritionist Toni A. Gerbino, the Diet Alternatives Plan allowed her to lose 110 pounds and keep it off for the past 30 years. Now, she would like to share her experience and expertise in order to help others with their weight loss.

We are proud of the education to back our methods and get you the results you desire.  So no training you into the ground and no crash diets!!

You are going to lift weights.  Period.  We believe whole heartedly in building a solid foundation in training and building lean muscle.  We don't believe for a second if you're a female that you'll get big and bulky.  That is a myth.  Our core training revolves around strength work while using other modalities to give you the best physique you're after. NY Strong is a non-intimidating environment and welcomes ALL levels of fitness.  You can participate in one on one sessions with our qualified personal trainers or join the fun and effective small group classes.

Our approach to nutrition is among the best, we are different because we do a thorough body fat assessment taking 12 measurements and calculate for you your macros (protein, carbs and fat).  This gives you your calorie count and is the most effective way to burn fat because they will be based off of YOUR gender, YOUR age, YOUR height, YOUR current weight, and YOUR amount of training.

Nutritional Balancing is a well-documented science using Hair Mineral Analysis to uncover deficiencies and imbalances within the body that create stress and symptoms.  

Symptoms are the body's way of communicating needs, and many bodily signs we take for granted could indicate much more severe problems.  For example, ridging in the nails usually indicate an iron deficiency.  But taking iron alone, will not correct the imbalance.  Its the relationship of the minerals in your body that gives you vitality.  We teach you what to look for, and how to respond to it allowing deep, permanent healing so you can go out and live a happy, healthy life.

Ayurveda (pronounced ""eye+ur+vay+duh) is a holistic system of medicine from India that incorporates the body, mind and consciousness when evaluating disease. It is the sister-science to yoga and the two are used hand in hand to resolve physical, emotional and energetic imbalances.

Integrating the principles of ayurveda, yoga, and meditation I will custom design a wellness plan to achieve your goals. Energetic imbalances often manifest as undiagnosable symptoms. If left unchecked, these may worsen and eventually manifest into disease. Using a holistic, supportive approach, Ayurveda targets the root cause to address energetic imbalances that are causing your symptoms (stress, anxiety, migraines, bloating, constipation, sinus congestion, lethargy, emotional eating, tinnitus, acne, anger, insomnia, ADHD, etc.).

Inspiring Health,nutritionists,"In my holistic practice, I focus on stress and the underlying issues related to illness. Long-term stress challenges the body's ability to self-regulate, or heal itself naturally, and leads to disease.

My focus on Self- Regulation, as a systemic model of health and wellness, is considerably different than the Disease model, which is designed to diagnose and treat symptoms only, and often at the expense of overall systemic functioning. The Self-Regulation model considers the bigger picture and addresses the whole system, including underlying health issues that may be present. 

I use three different tools. The first is Nutritional Balancing, which is based on a Hair Mineral Analysis (HMA). This is a simple way to measure how the body is managing stress biochemically, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of adrenal, thyroid and blood sugar functions, as well as the functionality of overall metabolism. 

The second tool I use is Biofeedback. For this, I rely on some of the most state-of-the-art technologies coming from Germany and Russia.  These technologies capture data on the energy, or information field, of the body. They then provide corrective information back to the body, in the form of biofeedback, which stimulates the body's own self-regulatory capacities and promotes proper immune function.

The third tool is Astrology, which can both assist a person on a transformational path, and reveal ways in which that person manages stress.",inspiringhealth.net,(310) 773-2323,"11600 Washington Pl Los Angeles, CA 90066 ","https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PdCqtVfAkDrWP5gWA4OfIg/o.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/opkGUNycEfymhPpJW1UHXg/o.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sR_94kk5L50ech3mgI1CjA/o.jpg,","Nutritionists,Counseling & Mental Health,",Los Angeles,90066

Part yoga, part Tour de France, people burn an average of 500 calories and up to 900 calories per class with the unique spinning combination of low-impact upper and lower body movements and because of its low impact on the joints, it's the best choice for the injured.

Pilates:The Pilates method of body conditioning is a unique system of lengthening, strengthening and stretching exercises. As current trends move away from the bulky, muscular body type, Pilates lengthens, while toning muscles, actually improving flexibility and creating a more streamline body. 

Nutrition, Wellness, Health and Cooking Lectures and Classes

A perfect combination of cardio meets stretch plus core work. 45-50 minutes of spin to burn calories, and 20 minutes of core exercises.

-New Guidelines-

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use. We will provide disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer to all members.",velocitybootcamp.com,(323) 206-6348,"2306 Hyperion Ave Hyperion Arts Complex Los Angeles, CA 90027 ","https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1ah_MTdMplRtOGBoYkX7NA/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QvSTouquLAyKEo0ll5wjWw/o.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bqCBuKfniIyMG60KYgbrug/o.jpg,","Trainers,Boot Camps,Weight Loss Centers,",Los Angeles,90027

In8 Love Wellness,nutritionists,"Dr. Tanya M. Reynolds, Doctor of Chiropractic Health Care; BS in Dietary Nutrition, has led her professional health care practice for over 10 years. She is currently serving patients at In8Love Chiropractic in West Los Angeles, California. She has cared for thousands of patients&nbsp;and has performed over 250,000 adjustments.
Dr. Tanya's passion for Chiropractic originated at the age of 15 when an MD diagnosed her with cervical dysplasia (precancerous cells of the cervix). To say the least, this was a most shocking realization. After several unsuccessful surgeries, she consulted with a Chiropractor who immediately started a series of manual manipulation, adjustments, and dietary changes.
Surprisingly after several months, she was re-tested for cancer and was cleared of the cervical dysplasia. Thankfully, additional surgery was determined unnecessary for the teenage child. Amazed by this miracle that healed her health, Dr. Tanya began studying and learning all that she could about Chiropractic.
Dr. Tanya took this passion to Life University in Marietta, Georgia. She graduated with both her BS in Dietary Nutrition, followed by a Doctorate of Chiropractic Health Care. Dedicated to spreading the word about Chiropractic, she became a Chiropractic Assistant for an office in her hometown Naples, Florida. Soon thereafter she opened her own office in January 2003.

Ron Le Fitness,nutritionists,"Ron Le has been on America's Best TV show on ION Television, featured on Arroyo Magazine, and has also been a judge for Miss Teen LA. Ron Le Fitness specializes in weight loss and toning.  Ron Le has a proven track record for helping clients.  He is very proud of the fact that he can turn anyone into an athlete even if they are extremely out of shape to begin with.  His gift for training un-athletic clients stem from the fact that he was once in their shoes and has had to do countless research in the science of strength in order to get strong.  Strength did not come naturally to him, he really had to study his way to being strong.  Today, Ron has the ability to barbell squat over 400lbs at 150lbs of bodyweight.    His own personal fitness journey taught him mistakes to avoid and made him very empathetic of all his clients.  Ron firmly believes that it is much more impressive to be able to help an out of shape client reach their goals.  It is far more challenging and rewarding to train clients who lack the motivation and natural physical abilities.  Ron believes that if a personal trainer can make an out of shape person become very athletic, then that personal trainer has the ability to train anyone.  That is why Ron is the personal trainer of choice for many extremely talented athletes including:  nationally ranked lifters, world class BJJ artists, models, best selling authors, co-owner of the golden state warriors, and many doctors!",ronlefitness.com,(903) 908-2008,"Pasadena, CA 91107 ","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OMyGoDtXldgxYYtI7uAZIw/o.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xJE9BhLpYXL71dTxdYnHIQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ken5Udc1-Opz4ipII6Nyqg/o.jpg,","Trainers,",Pasadena,91107

Trinity Holistic Health Center,nutritionists,"Trinity Holistic Health Center's approach is based on the theory that health and disease are life processes related to the function of the nervous system.  Stress factors that interfere with the normal communication through the nervous system is almost always, part of the root cause of disease.

The nervous system is the hard wired communication network that connects the brain to every cell of your body.
Therefore, diagnosis is the identification of whatever is interfering with communication (stress) through the nervous system.  Treatment is the removal of the interfering factor by the most conservative method available.

WholeHealth Chicago,nutritionists,"We offer the following services: internal medicine, Chiropractic, clinical and energy psychology, TCM/acupuncture, nutritional counseling, physical therapy, homeopathy, bioidentical hormone replacement, IV therapies, and anti-aging therapies.

WholeHealth Chicago is the Midwest's oldest and most respected center for integrative care, successfully blending the latest advances in conventional medicine with a wide range of clinically proven alternative therapies.   

Integrative Medicine is a growing field in which the patient and provider work together to develop a diagnostic and therapeutic program that makes sense for the individual. It combines the discipline of modern science with the wisdom of ancient healing.

This means for each patient our practitioners rely on the best evidence-based medicine and individualize a treatment plan-what we call a healing path. Your healing path might include one or more types of treatment, diagnostic testing, natural and pharmaceutical therapies, as well as referrals to other practitioners.
For people living with chronic or life-threatening illness, integrative medicine can transform life's physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. Integrative medicine can also be life-changing for those who are not ill but want to increase self-awareness, enhance well-being, and prevent health problems.

Windy City Strength & Conditioning,nutritionists,"At Windy City, we believe real fitness is more than getting on a treadmill and watching TV -- it's about strengthening and conditioning your body and mind so you can get out there, explore the world, seek new adventures and be the person you were meant to be.

Our facility is a huge loft space with exposed brick, natural light and seasoned equipment from years of hard work. 

Whether you're new to fitness or a seasoned athlete, our coaches are trained to help you set goals, teach proper form, and design programs that include basic barbell exercises, olympic lifts, kettlebells, gymnastics, running, rowing, and a long list of bodyweight moves.

Here, you'll never feel lost, alone or confused about what exercises to do or how to do them. That's because your Windy City membership includes a lot more than just a room full of equipment. Whether you're looking for group classes or private training, we'll take care of everything--just show up ready to move and let the transformation begin.

As the first CrossFit facility in Chicago, we believe in the founding principles of functional fitness. And there's also talk about that mountain bike trip in Utah with friends, or that 5k that was once impossible, or that Breast Cancer Walk, or traveling the world, or finally finding a gym that feels like home. And when we lay our heads down at night, we can't wait to see what's in store for tomorrow.

You will then be given tailored corrective exercises to maintain the gains from the session until you are ultimately pain free.

Hard Body By Tommie,nutritionists,"""Tommie Allen opened One on One in 1998 to provide an atmosphere that would lend itself to hard work, perseverance, and results. When you want to get in shape, you don't want to stand around waiting for the next machine, while you listen to your trainer's personal problems. You want results. Here you are guaranteed a goal motivated work out, set to a pace designed for your body. There is no computer telling me how to train you. Over the years, Tommie has successfully trained more than 500 clients with outstanding results. At One on One, you will realize the fruits of your work.

Tommie opened the private, client based personal training studio because he knew no one serious about getting in shape liked the hustle of the ""Mega-Gyms"". Your work out is not a spectator event. It is between you and your trainer. At our Personal Fitness Studio, we do not group train, because no one else has your body. You are unique and your work out should not be minimized, it should be maximized.

The goal of One on One is to make you feel as though you are working out at home... without the distraction. He continuously endeavors to provide new and innovative equipment and ideas for your fitness improvement. When you choose a personal trainer here at One on One Personal Fitness Studio, it is all about you.

The True Wellness Center,nutritionists,"The True Wellness Center is based on the European BioRegulatory Approach to Health. The True Wellness philosophy centers on the understanding that today's health challenges arise from the many layers of toxic health stressors and a lack of proper nutrition. Over time, these health stressors cause a breakdown in a person's immune system and a disruption in the natural self-regulation or compensation of the body. As the disruption of these systems continues, it will lead to symptoms and eventual illness and disease.
 
Much like snow flakes piling up, one upon another, these health stressors overwhelm the body's ability to naturally heal itself. There is never just one thing responsible for an individual's illness or disease. The underlying cause of illness is rather a cascade or a snowstorm of physical, environmental and toxic emotional health stressors. True Wellness focuses on stopping this storm of overburden and the ""layering of snow flakes"" and then clearing away the toxic build-up.",TheTrueWellnessCenter.com,(267) 308-0777,"1364 Welsh Rd Ste A100 North Wales, PA 19454 ","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V2KZvBpHbhAXpldHwpToJA/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DIpFpKx9sYOz33Div1bfWQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vE8XQkXsOVlhIcspJFwNUA/o.jpg,","Nutritionists,Yoga,Halotherapy,",North Wales,19454

No, because it's not your body that tells you to stop, your mind does. Whether you tell yourself you can&nbsp;or can't do something, you are right but ReBoot Fitness are here to push you and make you realize it's only you against yourself.&nbsp;Reboot fitness is for everyone but you have to want it!

Before you consider Reboot Fitness, they need three things from&nbsp;YOU:
1. They need you to have a goal, and by goal they don't mean a dream, they mean a ""must"" have, an all or nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;goal.
2. They need you to know what you are worth, look in the mirror, see that person..yea, BELIEVE in that person!
3. They need you to bring 110% of effort in the gym at all times. People don't realize the most simplest aspect of training, the amount of effort and dedication you put in is the amount that's given to you in the end.

Are you ready to make a change?

Fertile Lifestyle,nutritionists,"I specialize in women's health issues, and infertility. I believe that treatment has to include all aspects of a persons health, to achieve wellness with infertility and other more chronic issues. This is why I combine Traditional Chinese medicine with blood and or hormone saliva testing (using Functional Medicine's more accurate blood/hormone lab ranges.)
With a thorough history, current lab results, and great diagnostics, we can focus on what will provide the best fertile health. My goal for my patients is to not only feel their best, but be able to conceive and hold their pregnancy(s)!

Treatments may include: acupuncture, moxabustion, cupping, guasha, herbal medicine, tuina massage, vitamin/mineral supplementation, recommended blood/saliva testing, as well as dietary and lifestyle recommendation.

FYI for those needing to use insurance: 
I can't accept Anthem BC, as I'm not a provider (despite what the internet may say). If you have American Specialty Health as part of your holistic plan for treatment, this applies.

Sensotherapy Weight Loss,nutritionists,"Dallas Medical Weight Loss Program with Real Results, Not Empty Promises. Doctor Supervised.

Is there anything as over-hyped and underperforming as claims made by weight loss programs? We've all heard the pitches before, lose weight fast; drop X pounds in Y days; use this tip to shed the fat; get a bathing suit body without any effort. Even the medical industry has cashed in on our pursuit of the perfect body image with various medical diets and prescriptions targeting our desire for a ""quick fix"". Most people in our society have tried at least one diet or weight loss program in their lifetime, and the vast majority of these have failed to deliver results or have required numerous doctor visits, expensive prescriptions or cumbersome dietary requirements. Quite often it's necessary to purchase expensive food plans. In our system you can eat regular food and dine in your favorite restaurants, and once a week you can eat as much as your want and whatever you want.

Most patients start the medical weight loss program following our guideline with a monthly weight loss prescription for Phentermine or Adipex. For patients that have complications, or other issues that prevent them from taking Phentermine, the weight loss practice often suggests a similar weight loss plan that relies on Sensotherapy.

Sensotherapy is an opportunity for you to break away from the stale promises of traditional diets and weight loss programs...",bestweightlossdoctor.com,(972) 239-5572,"12850 Spurling Rd Ste 110 Dallas, TX 75230 ","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0fzuzGUcl0gs6zXXQQYn_g/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vpkb5TAa5xT3VHOzV2YW-Q/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GsZSdEI4pYlRziTQz1Yw7A/o.jpg,","Nutritionists,Doctors,Medical Centers,",Dallas,75230
