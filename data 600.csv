Compass Nutrition,Active Life,"Are you looking for a fresh approach to eating? Compass Nutrition creates a trusting and supportive environment to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle. We do not believe in judgment, deprivation, punishment, guilt, and all-or-nothing rules. 

We focus on creating enjoyable habits that lead to healthy behaviors. Our approach is simple: eat what you like, learn to moderate certain foods and make informed food decisions. 

We teach our patients new skills or reinforce current skills, so that they can get to know and trust their own body cues, move away from diet rules (and rule breaking), learn better and more insight-oriented coping strategies. Our goal is to move towards a more natural, balanced, self-led style of eating and relationship with food.

During your appointment, you will find that our treatments go beyond issuing short-term meal plans. We help our patients figure out what got their eating off-track and what perceptions, attitudes, and life-style habits are contributing factors.

For some, finding that balance is merely a matter of awareness - of how to bring a fresh approach of good eating and physical activity to each day.

For others, coordinating medical nutrition therapy and daily physical activity with other health care professionals and support groups may be what is needed.

Whatever your needs are we can individually assess and design a plan that is right for you and your goals.

Rolfing Structural Integration is a highly effective way of working with the body-mind to resolve conflicts, which prevent easier, more efficient ways of moving and being. A Rolfer® is highly trained to see, and address the complex ways in which the body-mind is relating to itself and its environment. The more balanced these relationships are, the more choice we will have in our experience. Through hands-on manipulation, and movement (perceptual) education, Rolfing is a very precise and effective way to change deep-set habits of posture, movement, and orientation. Rolfing is an effective approach to addressing the after-effects of accidents, injuries, and for many cases of acute and chronic pain. How we are in our bodies contextualizes perception, and the activity of the mind in general. For these reasons, Rolfing can be useful in affecting positive change in emotional, and behavioral issues.

Our practice is not just for back pain, but also sport-related injuries and chronic movement dysfunction. All of these problems can wreak havoc on our overall health and well being.

Norman Marcus Pain Institute,Active Life,"Whether your pain is recent or long-standing, it should not be ignored. Ongoing pain can interfere with every aspect of life, ranging from the ability to sleep to the capacity to enjoy daily activities. The Norman Marcus Pain Institute provides consultation, state-of-the-art protocols to diagnose the cause of pain, and treatments that help patients eliminate (or manage) the source of their discomfort.

NMPI successfully eliminates pain in patients who were previously diagnosed with sciatica, radiculopathy, failed back surgery syndrome, degenerative disc disease, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS, previously called reflex sympathy dystrophy, or RSD), plantar fasciitis, or Fibromyalgia Syndrome. NMPI improves the quality of patient's lives.
Evaluation
A visit begins with an evaluation to determine the source of pain. Determining why you have pain is both simple and complicated. Pain that began in the past 2 months is generally easier to understand than pain that has troubled you for years.

In addition to identifying pain that may come from a herniated disc or a squeezed nerve, Dr. Marcus evaluates muscles, the most common cause of back and neck pain, as possible sources of pain.

Just Feel Good,Active Life,"Hi there, my name is Coleen and I'm a nutrition consultant and wellness entrepreneur running a successful private practice in NYC with an office in Manhattan (Flatiron) and Brooklyn (Prospect Heights). People see me to reach their goal weight, gain energy, eliminate cramps &amp; PMS, mangage PCOS, sleep better, clear up digestive issues, stop sugar addiction, manage depression, clear up skin conditions, speed their metabolism and learn how to eat healthfully in an increasingly unhealthy world. My program is not a quick fix but rather a long term solution to many chronic issues (and yes, dieting is a chronic issue!). Submit a health history form via my website (click ""Get Started"" on the home page) to reserve your free consultation.

Acupuncture works.  

Acupuncture improves flow of oxygen (Qi), blood (Xue) and nutrients (Ying) to nourish every cell, organ and physiological system of the body.  Impaired flow of blood and oxygen causes Blood Stagnation, which prevents the body from functioning properly, resulting in disease, pain, inability to heal, and emotional disturbances. Acupuncture dilates blood vessels to improve blood flow, which improves organ function, relieves pain, and minimizes aging.

Acupuncture stimulates the nervous system by activating sensory nerves that travel through the skin, along the spine and into the brain, stimulating the release of opioids to shut off pain signals and eliminate pain.

A multitude of scientific studies using modern techniques such as MRI, show that Acupuncture modulates areas of the brain which initiate changes in bodily functions. Specific Acupuncture points are seen to stimulate/moderate specific areas of the brain. These effects continue to work over hours and days, and the effects are cumulative.",sophieyoungacupuncture.com,(917) 446-5275,"Diamond St Brooklyn, NY 11222 ","https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oNbWNuAM0dtsFAb_p19Bpg/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q8fdFw4nnVjW6eIn5wnUiA/o.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RgC0RJFg9G0z5bTsIUQlUQ/o.jpg,","Acupuncture,Traditional Chinese Medicine,",Brooklyn,11222

The preschool years are a crucial window in a child's academic, social and cultural development. In the few years spent at The International Preschools, a child will develop not only academic skills but also social skills and cultural attitudes. At The International Preschools, where English language learners are welcomed and supported, children and families from New York City and all over the world share their cultures and gain a sense of international awareness through mutual understanding and respect. Through play, we promote the cognitive, emotional, social and physical growth of each child in a nurturing atmosphere.

"Nick Helbich, PhD, LCSW",Active Life,"Life today is more complicated than ever. I can provide the help you need to meet life's challenges. Let's begin this journey to the life you want to live.

My clients and I meet usually on a weekly basis. For people who travel a lot I offer Skype and phone sessions.

My fee is $ 250.00 to 300.00 per session which is reimbursed if you have out of network benefits.

Although we tend to categorize therapies, we can't do the same with people, as everyone has a completely different set of experiences and problems. And so I draw from a wide variety of treatment methods. My clinical orientation and training is integrative, as it combines Psychodynamic, Interpersonal and Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) perspectives. I am well schooled in Modern Psychoanalysis, Self Psychology, Focusing and Client Centered Therapy and have received extensive training in individual, couples and group psychotherapy. One of the approaches I often use is mindfulness meditation, as the body holds onto past traumas that our minds may not always remember. I will discuss all the treatment options with you and find the one that will work best for you.

I provide treatment options that can also help with difficult relationships involving family, friends, even co-workers.",dr-nick-helbich.com,(646) 270-7255,"205 West 15th St Ste 6-T The Chelsmore New York, NY 10011 ","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hlHIA1UVUNG3iy7FUBmZOw/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XD17Q24WO8KFP3TvXOV6xA/o.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7sETlchTuPULrT28jVhsYA/o.jpg,","Psychologists,",New York,10011

Rather than offering patients a single option for care we have combined the best of several independent practices and specialties to create a more effective way at treating pain. The office has assembled specialists in orthopedics, physical therapy, internal medicine, pain management, physical medicine, chiropractic and acupuncture. By bringing together several independent practices a patient can get get the best of what each specialist has to offer at one location.
The result is patients have a greater chance of getting out of pain and just as importantly, staying out of pain.
The response from patients and professional peers has been tremendous. The office continues to gain recognition as one of the premier musculoskeletal facilities in New York. The ultimate validation of the approach has been the fact almost all of the facilities patients have been referred from other patients and physicians.
